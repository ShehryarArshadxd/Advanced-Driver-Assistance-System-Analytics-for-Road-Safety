Advanced Driver Assistance System: Analytics for Road Safety

Project Overview:

This project aims to develop an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) by leveraging computer vision techniques. The system will primarily focus on two core functionalities—vehicle recognition and lane recognition—while integrating additional features such as distance estimation, object tracking, and lane departure analysis. By processing real-time video feeds from onboard cameras, the solution will detect vehicles, identify lane markers, and estimate the distance to surrounding objects. This comprehensive approach enhances situational awareness and provides actionable insights to support safe driving.

Rationale & Market Relevance:

Road safety remains a critical global challenge, with human error being a leading cause of accidents. Current ADAS technologies have demonstrated that timely detection of road elements can significantly reduce accident risks. This project addresses the following market needs:
•	Enhanced Safety: By combining vehicle and lane recognition with distance estimation and object tracking, the system offers a robust safety net for drivers, potentially reducing collision risks.
•	Cost-Effective Solution: Utilizing open-source computer vision libraries and readily available hardware makes the system an attractive proposition for automotive manufacturers and aftermarket solutions.
•	Scalability: The modular design allows for integration of additional features (e.g., traffic sign recognition, pedestrian detection) to meet future market demands.
•	Research & Development: This project contributes to academic and industrial research in computer vision, offering a testbed for experimenting with state-of-the-art algorithms in real-world scenarios.
